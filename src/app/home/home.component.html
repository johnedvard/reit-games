  What are NFTs exactly? It stands for "non fungible token", which simply means
  that one token is unique. We hear a lot about NFTs being images these days,
  but it doesn't have to be an image. It can be anything. The main idea is that
  you can own an NFT. The content of an NFT itself can change over time, even
  the ownership. To illustrate this, I have created an NFT for you. You are free
  to make changes to it, but I decide what you are allowed to change. How's that
  possible? The NFT I have created is deployed to my smart contract (yet another
  strange term.) It means that I have written code to define what owners, and
  non-owners are allowed to change on the NFT. It's easier to explain using an
  example. Here's my NFT.
