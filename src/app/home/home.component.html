<p>
  What are NFTs exactly? It stands for "non fungible token", which simply means
  that one token is unique. We hear a lot about NFTs being images these days,
  but it doesn't have to be an image. It can be anything. The main idea is that
  you can own an NFT. The content of an NFT itself can change over time, even
  the ownership. To illustrate this, I have created an NFT for you. You are free
  to make changes to it, but I decide what you are allowed to change. How's that
  possible? The NFT I have created is deployed to my smart contract (yet another
  strange term.) It means that I have written code to define what owners, and
  non-owners are allowed to change on the NFT. It's easier to explain using an
  example. Here's my NFT.

<div class="nft-token" *ngIf="reitGamesNft">
  <img
    alt="profile picture of the NFT author"
    [src]="reitGamesNft.metadata.media"
  />
  <label>Title: {{ reitGamesNft.metadata.title }}</label>
  <label>Description: {{ reitGamesNft.metadata.description }}</label>
  <form [formGroup]="nftForm">
    <input
      label="Change description"
      [value]="reitGamesNft.metadata.description"
      formControlName="nftDescription"
    />
    <button
      type="button"
      (click)="updateNftToken(reitGamesNftId)"
      [disabled]="!nftForm.valid || nftForm.pristine"
    >
      Change description
    </button>
  </form>
</div>

<p>Ok, cool, but what can I do with an NFT?</p>
<p>
  Good question, and there's actually a lot of things we can do depending on the
  application using the NFT and implementing the contract. What we mostly see
  are marketplaces such as
  <a href="https://www.mintbase.io/">mintbase.io</a> and
  <a href="https://paras.id/">paras.id</a>. They make it possible to mint
  (create,) list and sell NFTs. I decided to use the NFTs in a series of
  mini-games. When you login to the NEAR wallet, and play any of our mini-games,
  you'll be able to use the NFT (and others') in the game. It's easier if I give
  you an example
